# React-Code-Smells-Dataset-Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a React Component Smell Dataset that was gathered and synthetically generated using two specific tools. 

## Files
1. **DatasetAnalysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.

2. **DatasetFiles.zip**: Compressed archive containing snippet files associated with the React smells.

3. **sample_smells_dataset.csv**: CSV file providing detailed information about the React smells dataset. It includes columns for file name, smell name, and relative path.

## React Smells
- Inefficient Rendering
- Props in Initial State
- Too Many Props
- Low Cohesion
- Props Drilling
- Inheritance instead of Composition

## Usage
1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Open and explore `DatasetAnalysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook for insights into the React smells dataset.

2. **Dataset Files:** Extract the contents of `DatasetFiles.zip` to access individual snippet files associated with each React smell.

3. **CSV Dataset:** Utilize `sample_smells_dataset.csv` for a structured overview of the React smells, including file names, smell names, and relative paths.

Feel free to use this dataset for research, analysis, or any other purposes related to understanding and addressing React component smells.
